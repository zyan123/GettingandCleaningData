This was written for coursera course Getting and Cleaning data and this is the final project.
In this project, we need to clean the origional data and provide a tidy data for further study

In this project,we download data from the website
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
And the data was originally comes from the link below
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

What we did was to contain this readme file, a R file named "run_analysis.R" which consists of five parts:
1, Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2, Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3, Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4, Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5, From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

we also cntain a code book of the data we cleaned in this repository
